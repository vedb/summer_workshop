### File copying
1. Copy a file from your computer to your personal VM
2. Find an interesting file to download to your computer with `wget` (an image, a novel, a dataset?)
    * Once you find an interesting file browsing around, you will need to right-click the image or other file, and select "copy link" (or equivalent). Please paste this somewhere (in a browser window, a text file, etc) to assure that you have a downloadable URL to use with `wget` - i.e., it should start with `http://` or `https://` and it should end with a file extension (e.g. `.jpg` or `.zip`). If the thing you copied does not look like a file, the thing you want is probably hidden somehow by the way it is served on the web page you are on. 

### Software installation
1. Install cowsay, ncdu, tree; explore what they do! 
2. Install a program of your choice! ideas: 
    * command line ascii art programs
    * fancy utilities (search "must-have command line programs" or some such)
    * command-line games
